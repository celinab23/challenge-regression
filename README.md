# challenge-regression

### Description

This repository corresponds to the machine learning stage or a larger data project: immo-eliza. <br>
The objective is to train a neural network regression model to predict the price of a property. <br><br>

### Timeline<br>
- Day 1: <br>
    - Short search about options for neural networks regression models. <br>
        Found two options: Sklearn and TensorFlow. <br>
    - Follow introduction chapter to TensorFlow on DataCamp. <br>
    - Started the date pre-processing under data-preprocessing.ipynb .<br><br>

- Day 2: <br>
    - Finished data preprocessing. <br>
        Formated the preprocessing notebook with markdown. <br>
        Created the data-preprocessing.py file containing the functions used during such process.<br>
    - Feature engineering <br>
        Calculated the distance of each property to the capital of the province it is situated in. <br><br>

- Day 3: <br>
    - Followed part of the Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras course in DataCamp.<br>
    - Read about how to create a neural network regression model.<br>
    - From there, a very basic model was built. However, was unable to measure its accuracy.<br>
    - Part of the pre-processing had to be remade, to appropiately handle type of property<br><br>

- Day 4:<br>
    - Model was completed but returning very low accurary (299880).<br>
    - Data preprocessing notebook transferred to .py file.

### Personal situation<br>
Data preprocessing took a significant amount of time. <br>
Feature engineering was also a time-consuming challege. <br>
However, not as long as the pre-processing step. <br>
