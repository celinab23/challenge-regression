# challenge-regression

### Description

This repository corresponds to the machine learning stage or a larger data project: immo-eliza. <br>
The objective is to train a neural network regression model to predict the price of a property. <br><br>

### Timeline<br>
- Day 1: <br>
    - Short search about options for neural networks regression models. <br>
        Found two options: Sklearn and TensorFlow. <br>
    - Follow introduction chapter to TensorFlow on DataCamp. <br>
    - Started the date pre-processing under data-preprocessing.ipynb .<br><br>

- Day 2: <br>
    - Finished data preprocessing. <br>
        Formated the preprocessing notebook with markdown. <br>
        Created the data-preprocessing.py file containing the functions used during such process.<br>
    - Feature engineering <br>
        Calculated the distance of each property to the capital of the province it is situated in. <br><br>

### Personal situation<br>
Data preprocessing took a significant amount of time. <br>
Feature engineering was also a time-consuming challege. <br>
However, not as long as the pre-processing step. <br>
